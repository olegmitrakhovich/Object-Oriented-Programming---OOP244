1)	A safe empty state is when all your class variables are 
initialized at zero or null. In this particular program a safe empty 
state is when the constructors executes a function called setEmpty(). I 
used the safe empty state for this program to actually check if the info 
in the object is false or not, if the object is in a safe empty state my 
program knew that the objects information entered was invalid. A safe 
empty states protects a program from any segmentation faults and also 
could help against memory leaks.
2)	Using constructors is great for validation, since there is no 
way to call up a constructor and it is called automatically upon 
creation of an object. The fact that a constructor gets called up 
automatically, saves on lines when you write your program, this makes 
everything easier to read.
