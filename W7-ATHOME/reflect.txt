1.	It was not necessary to create an isEmpty() class member function in the Superhero class, because that function was already inherited from the Hero class.
2.	My strength member was automatically set to private.
3.	Declaring something protected could cause memory leaks and other problems. It all comes down to working on bigger projects and how other developers use your class, if a person doesn’t understand your class 
	fully and they create a subclass from it, it could mess your base class if its not encapsulated properly.
4.	My safe empty state would have to be different from what it is now. I would set all double members to zero, but keep the name stored the way it was passed in. I would also change my isEmpty() function to 
	return true or false based on the values of the numbered variables.
5.	Because you can’t assign a derived object from SuperHero class (o2) to a base class (Hero) in such a way, since the hierarchy would mess up the assignment process. However, the base class object “o” is 
	only being assigned what was already being inherited earlier upon creation.
