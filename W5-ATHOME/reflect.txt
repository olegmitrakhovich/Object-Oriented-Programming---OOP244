1.Friend helper functions break encapsulation. It might not matter as 
much when a person is writing a small program, however if it is a huge 
project with many classes and other functions which based heavily on 
encapsulation, it could become extremely hard to read the ever expanding 
written program.

2. The compiler just casts the value which is a double value to a 
nearest double variable in that class. The definition of casting is an 
object made by pouring molten metal or other material into a mold. So 
the compiler just looks for a “mold” aka variable to fit that value in.
